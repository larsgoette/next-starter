# Next Starter

A modern and opinionated [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) starter template with a focus on developer experience and best practices. Built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and includes essential tooling for code quality and optimization.

## 💡 Philosophy

This starter was created with one key principle in mind: **You should spend your time building, not configuring**.

Unlike many starter templates that come loaded with features you may never use, this template provides just what you need to start building right away. No time wasted removing unused dependencies or reconfiguring bloated setups. Every included feature and configuration serves a purpose, creating a foundation that's ready for immediate development while maintaining complete flexibility for your project's specific needs.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Create new project using this starter
npx create-next-app@latest --example "https://github.com/larsgoette/next-starter" [your-project-name]

# Navigate to the project
cd your-project-name

# Start the development server
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### App Directory

The `src/app` directory contains the core Next.js application files:

```
app/
├── apple-icon.png         # [Auto-generated] iOS icon
├── config.tsx             # Global configuration
├── favicon.ico            # [Auto-generated] Browser favicon
├── globals.css            # Global styles
├── icon.svg               # [Auto-generated] Modern browsers icon
├── layout.tsx             # Root layout
├── manifest.ts            # PWA manifest
├── opengraph-image.tsx    # OG image generator
└── page.tsx               # Homepage
```

Files marked with `[Auto-generated]` are created and managed by the `npm run favicons` script. You should not edit these files directly as they will be overwritten when the script runs.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit `src/app/config.ts` to customize your application:

```typescript
// Basic settings
export const APP_LANG = "en";
export const APP_NAME = "Acme Studio";
export const APP_TITLE = "Welcome to the Future.";
export const BASE_URL = "https://example.com";

// Theme settings
export const THEME_COLOR = "#ffffff";
export const LOADING_BACKGROUND_COLOR = "#ffffff";
export const OG_BACKGROUND_COLOR = "#fafafa";
export const APPLE_ICON_BACKGROUND_COLOR = "#fafafa";
```

## 🛠️ Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run favicons` - Generate favicon assets

### Favicon Generation

Generate optimized favicon assets with:

```bash
npm run favicons -- path/to/your/image.[svg|png]
```

This creates:

- `favicon.ico` for browsers
- `apple-icon.png` (180x180)
- `icon.svg` or `icon.png` for modern browsers
